# Fact-Fiction
 - Created as part of Undergrad coursework.
 - Fact-Fiction is a web template that provides a foundational layout to build your own storytelling portals. This template, engineered with HTML and CSS, is a versatile canvas for users to link narratives with the real-life facts that inspired them.
 - The Fact-Fiction template showcases my proficiency in creating adaptable web designs that cater to content creators interested in the intersection of literature and history.
