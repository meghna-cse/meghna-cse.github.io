      <p><br>
			Newton's second law of motion can be  used conveniently to derive the equation of motion of a system under the following conditions:<br>
			<ol style="padding-left: 2em;">
				<li>The system undergoes either pure translation or pure rotation.</li>
				<li>The motion takes place in a single plane.</li>
				<li>The force acting on the system either have a constant orientation or are oriented parallel to the direction along which the point of application moves.</li>
			</ol><br>
			Newton's second law states that the force applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration , the relationship between the two is<br><img src="http://vlab.amrita.edu/fckeditor/editor/plugins/fckeditor_wiris/integration/showimage.php?formula=c205459cfcec4d24d4c320356017bc34.png"><br><br>
			Where 'F' is the force applied, 'm' is the mass of the body, and 'a' is the body's acceleration. If the body is subject to multiple forces at the same time, then the acceleration is proportional to the vector sum (that is, the net force).<br><img src="http://vlab.amrita.edu/fckeditor/editor/plugins/fckeditor_wiris/integration/showimage.php?formula=ff8f97da0bb8e466846b305ad739852e.png"><br><br>
			The second law can also be used to relate the net force and the momentum 'p' of the body<br><img src="http://vlab.amrita.edu/fckeditor/editor/plugins/fckeditor_wiris/integration/showimage.php?formula=606290dad9a918748b5bb6e3bb06206e.png"><br><br>
			Therefore, Newton's second law also states that the net force is equal to the time derivative of the body's momentum<br><img src="http://vlab.amrita.edu/fckeditor/editor/plugins/fckeditor_wiris/integration/showimage.php?formula=0e5e3f1ba9aef396f81a62f6f2c5ea0f.png"><br><br>
			Consistent with the first law, the time derivative of the momentum is non-zero when the momentum changes direction, even if there is no change in its magnitude (see time derivative). The relationship also implies the conservation of momentum. When the net force on the body is zero, the momentum of the body is constant. Both statements of the second law are valid only for constant-mass systems, since any mass that is gained or lost by the system will cause a change in momentum that is not the result of an external force. A different equation is necessary for variable-mass systems. Newton's second law requires modification if the effects of special relativity are to be taken into account, as it cannot be said that momentum is the product of inertial mass and velocity.<br>
