      <p><br>
			Projectile is defined as, any body thrown with some initial velocity, which is then allowed to move under the action of gravity alone, without being propelled by any engine or fuel. The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory. A projectile moves at a constant speed in the horizontal direction while experiencing a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 downwards in the vertical direction. To be consistent, we define the up or upwards direction to be the positive direction. Therefore the acceleration of gravity is, -9.8 m/s2.<br><br>
			<h3>Horizontal motion of projectile</h3> 
			The speed in the horizontal direction is 'vx' and this speed doesn't change. The equation which predicts the position at any time in the horizontal direction is simply,<br><img src="http://vlab.amrita.edu/fckeditor/editor/plugins/fckeditor_wiris/integration/showimage.php?formula=c205459cfcec4d24d4c320356017bc34.png"><br><br>
			<h3>Vertical motion of projectile</h3>
			Because gravity has a downward pull, the vertical velocity changes constantly. The equation that predicts the vertical velocity at any time 'vy' is<br><img src="http://vlab.amrita.edu/fckeditor/editor/plugins/fckeditor_wiris/integration/showimage.php?formula=f95ec12762786ff5fa2010b60ca87eff.png"><br><br>The 'Voy' is simply the original velocity in the vertical or y-direction.<br> 
			To calculate the position in the y-direction, the full distance formula must be used. 'Yo', represents the original position in the y-direction.<br><img src="http://vlab.amrita.edu/fckeditor/editor/plugins/fckeditor_wiris/integration/showimage.php?formula=60f025b3986b1b8453e350b0069c490b.png"><br><br>
			Acceleration for projectiles near the Earth's surface is -9.8 m/s2. We don't re-write the equation with a negative sign.  Rather, we use the negative acceleration value when solving problems.<br>
			When a projectile is launched horizontally  a ball rolls off a table, a car runs off the edge of a cliff, etc.  Here the original y-velocity is zero. For example, if the projectile drops 10 meters, you can set the Yo = 0 and Yf = -10 m. Or, you can set Yo = 10 m and Yf = 0. Either works out the same.<br>
